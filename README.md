### Challenge Description

DPL is an app that tracks Libraries, the books that they have, and the authors of those books. Libraries have many books. Books belong to a Library. Books have many Authors and Authors have many Books. Authors should have a name and birth year.

Two migrations have been made for you. The one to many relationship has been set up. You will need to create migrations for the many to many relationship between books and authors. You do not need to do model testing for validations, just make sure you test any relationships and model methods that you create.


(Note: The plural of Library is Libraries.)
